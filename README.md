This repository contains an analysis of rainfall levels in Oxford and Melbourne through time.

To run this analysis use the following command:

```
Rscript script/combine-data.R
and then 
Rscript script/make-plot.R
```

The input data is in `data` and the results are in `output` 
The output of combine-data.R is saved in 'output' as an intermediary result
